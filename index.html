        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Michael Spence is an American poet who drove public-transit buses in the Seattle area for <strong>thirty years</strong>, retiring on <strong>February 14, 2014</strong>. His city-level vantage—engines humming, neon on rain—shapes much of his work. Before his transit career, Spence earned a B.A. in English from the University of Washington and served as a junior officer aboard the USS <em>John F. Kennedy</em> (CV-67).</p>

        <p>THE HOLLOW BARGAIN<br>
<br>
I am the bargain struck<br>
By the four gods—water,<br>
Earth, wind, and fire;<br>
The result of their ache<br>
To walk this world alive.<br>
Joining, we make five.<br>
Knives for fingers, the gods<br>
Open with space every part<br>
Of my body. My heart<br>
Is hollow for blood,<br>
My sculpted throat turns air<br>
To voice, and dreams flare<br>
In the cave of my skull.<br>
I stand where elements cross,<br>
Shaped by the emptiness<br>
Forming the bones of a gull<br>
For flight; holding—like a shell<br>
Its pearl—the ring of the bell.<br>
<br>

        <p>FIRST LOVE IN TWO DIMENSIONS<br>
<br>
Wandering through palmettos and scrub pine<br>
In Sarasota, I find the magazine<br>
Buried in the sand of the lot next door.<br>
I exhume it. Careful not to tear<br>
The pages stiff and crackling as dead leaves, I drink<br>
In every picture, reverent as a monk<br>
Poring over his parchment. It’s Christmas<br>
In July, and there at the center—unwrapped as<br>
A present from a gift box—lies the woman.<br>
The breath of a boy is small; since she has none,<br>
She takes all of mine. A triptych of desire<br>
Held by two staples where her underwear<br>
Isn’t, she dries out my mouth. At Holy Cross<br>
Junior High, the priest warned my all-male class:<br>
The fires of hell rise to consume forever<br>
Any who think impure thoughts. I grow hotter<br>
The more I stare, seeing her lips smile<br>
Yes to things I don’t know how to ask. I feel<br>
My heart thudding so loud I’m sure that soon<br>
I’ll burst into flame. Burying her again,<br>
I’m as cautious as a pirate—<br>
Ten paces west of a Spanish bayonet.<br>
Through summer, between swimming and fireworks,<br>
I come back to let her strike the sparks<br>
That will burn away my childhood. Though ash<br>
May be all I’m left with from the rush<br>
Of those days, beneath its layers the embers<br>
Lie with her. I still feel them smolder.<br>

<p>DARKEN SHIP<br>
<br>
At night, to keep the enemy<br>
From spotting us, our lights dimmed red:<br>
An ember&#39;s color which at sea<br>
Won&#39;t travel far. My recruiter had said<br>
The camaraderie of the sailors<br>
And sights I&#39;d see would give me tales<br>
For home. But on my carrier—<br>
A ship huge as a glacier of steel--<br>
Who could even meet the whole crew?<br>
To watch the stars, I&#39;d step out<br>
On the port quarter: the place we threw<br>
Our garbage overboard. That night,<br>
As I lounged in a far corner,<br>
Someone backed onto the ledge.<br>
I need more time! he cried. Two other<br>
Shadows pushed him to the edge.<br>
I yelled--two shapes stiffened to ice,<br>
The third halfway over the rail.<br>
The red lights, smudging each face,<br>
Made comrades of us all.<br>
<br>

<p>UNDERTOW<br>
<br>
I’m running down the corridors,<br>
Late for my watch on the bridge,<br>
For captain’s mast, for General Quarters.<br>
It’s winter, my face frigid:<br>
Why is my uniform tropical white?<br>
Down the passageways<br>
Of shadowless fluorescent light<br>
I gasp, but the view stays<br>
Unchanged—a tunnel of painted steel.<br>
I’m yelling: I did my time—<br>
And I resigned! This can’t be real!<br>
But all the ladders I climb<br>
Now lead to where the lifeboat is stored.<br>
The PA speakers blast:<br>
Man overboard! Man overboard!<br>
The boat’s being lowered. I’m last<br>
To grab a ratline and clamber in.<br>
My grip slips on the line—<br>
I hit the water. And wake: my skin<br>
Slick with the old brine.<br>

<p>EMISSARIES OF THE SUNLESS HOURS<br>
<br>
They board his bus near midnight. He knows<br>
These three are trouble: leather jackets black<br>
With rain and woven from the dark, the studs<br>
Of metal glinting randomly as stars.<br>
The one who comes on first is thin but tall,<br>
Hair blue as lapis, face pale as the fangs<br>
The driver’s pretty sure are porcelain.<br>
As sure as he is this trio will stiff him. Coins<br>
Sliding like liquid from his fingers, the Goth<br>
Looks at him: May I please have a transfer, sir?<br>
The driver waits for something more smart-ass<br>
As he hands him one. Bluehair nods: Thank you.<br>
Polite as well, the other two follow him<br>
To the bench seat in the back. I won’t go near<br>
That seat, an older woman told the driver<br>
This evening—that’s where all the assholes sit.<br>
In the rearview he sees a guy in a ball cap<br>
And Husky sweatshirt (the driver’s alma mater)<br>
Grin and shake his head as the three pass,<br>
Saying something to a girl across the aisle.<br>
She ignores him, the wire to her earbuds<br>
Trembling like a birfurcating vine<br>
In a breeze as her head shakes to a private tune.<br>
The bus goes by another dozen stops<br>
Before the bell rings. Ball Cap gets up,<br>
Leaning down as if to talk to her again,<br>
Then snatches at her iPod. She yelps, clinging<br>
To the thing while he growls: Gimme that, bitch!<br>
The driver’s calling the cops when he hears and feels<br>
A thud through his boot soles. The tall Goth<br>
Has tackled Ball Cap in the aisle, his friends<br>
Piling on, pinning him down. Give it back!<br>
The thin one says as the other two twist<br>
Ball Cap’s arms behind him till he squeals.<br>
Bluehair hands the device to the girl; her hand<br>
Shakes as she takes it. Now lemme up! yells<br>
The thief. Soon as the cops arrive, says the Goth,<br>
Looking up at the driver. Right, sir?<br>
The driver nods, grinning: From now on, any time<br>
You take my bus, you guys ride for free.<br>
<br>
(first published in The Hudson Review and The Bus Driver's Threnody)<br><br><br></p>

        <p>GLAD<br>
<br>
I’m glad that there’s this bus: my DUIs<br>
Mean someone else has gotta drive, surprise.<br>
To get to work by taxi’d cost a ton.<br>
A bike? You seen how many bikes get run<br>
Down on these roads? And I’d need to pedal an hour<br>
Each way, most likely during a downpour<br>
In the freezing dark. I used to think that losers<br>
Were the only ones who caught the bus. Like boozers<br>
Way worse than me—the kind who can never find<br>
Their fare. The driver oughta leave the bastards behind.<br>
Some people tell me they ride to save on gas<br>
And parking fees. Others are tired of the ass-<br>
Hole NASCAR wannabes on the freeway.<br>
I guess I’d say most of us here are okay.<br>
One day I sat behind these two old guys—<br>
So white, I swear, like a vampire’d sucked `em dry.<br>
One said all gloomy-sounding: A former duchess<br>
Of Westminster said anyone seen in a bus<br>
Over the age of thirty has been a failure.<br>
The other shrugged: Let’s give it one more year.<br>
Then they laughed like my buddies at a kegger.<br>
The redhead came on that day—I wanted to beg her<br>
To go out with me, the way I used to<br>
When I got wasted. But I held off. I knew<br>
Slow was how to take it: my last girlfriend<br>
Dumped me because I was a weird blend<br>
Of pushy/needy. Late that night the cop<br>
Who stopped and breathalyzed me said: You top<br>
My record for drunkest pull-over. Bye-bye,<br>
License. This morning I caught the redhead’s eye—<br>
She smiled, though she was talking on her cell,<br>
So I can’t really be sure. What if I tell<br>
Those old guys’ story to her? Would she laugh?<br>
But not today: yeah, don’t give her even half<br>
A reason to bolt. Might have a chance, you know?<br>
Maybe she’ll get on my bus tomorrow.<br>
