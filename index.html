      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Michael Spence is an American poet who drove public-transit buses in the Seattle area for <strong>thirty years</strong>, retiring on <strong>February 14, 2014</strong>. His city-level vantage—engines humming, neon on rain—shapes much of his work. Before his transit career, Spence earned a B.A. in English from the University of Washington and served as a junior officer aboard the USS <em>John F. Kennedy</em> (CV‑67).</p>
