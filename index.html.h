        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Michael Spence is an American poet who spent nearly four decades as a public-transit bus driver in Seattle while cultivating his poetic voice. His unique perspective on the rhythm of the city and the quiet profundities of everyday life informs his work. Before his transit career, Spence earned a B.A. in English from the University of Washington and served as a junior officer aboard the USS John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <blockquote>"In the glow of a streetlamp, an old man lingers, / hands clasped behind his back, waiting for the bus. / His shadow stretches like a lifetimeÑ / then folds itself into the open doors, / swallowed by the night."</blockquote>

        <h2>Poetic Themes</h2>
        <p>SpenceÕs poetry captures the transient beauty of daily encountersÑpassengers boarding a late-night bus, the hum of the engine beneath quiet contemplation, the echoes of history intertwined with the present.</p>
        <blockquote>"A city moves in restless sleep, its dreams / played out in neon and rain-streaked windows, / where ghosts ride silent in empty seats."</blockquote>
